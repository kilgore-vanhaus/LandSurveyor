# Land Surveyor: RuneLite plugin to visualize elevation data of nearby tiles

This RuneLite plugin provides elevation data as floating text above tiles.
Select how many tiles to scan for elevation data, and optionally customize the floating elevation text's color.

Hypsometric Mode is an elevation-based color gradient that can be applied to the floating text, the underlying tile, or both. The default red-green color scheme of Hypsometric mode can be altered, and the Gradient Sensitivity and Tile Opacity can likewise be adjusted.
